# Getting to Philosophy

I read/heard somewhere years ago that if you click on the first link of any Wikipedia article long enough, you get to either the article on Mathematics or Philosophy.

I wrote this scraper to test that.

## Requirements

- Python 3+
- BeautifulSoup 4+
- requests

## Usage

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./gtp
```

## Example
